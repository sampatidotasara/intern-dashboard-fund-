#Intern Fund Dashboard
 # Built a dashboard web application to track interns, their assigned projects, and 
  associated stipends/funds. The system allows admins to manage intern details, 
  allocate funds, and monitor disbursements while interns can log in to view their 
  profiles, assigned tasks, and payment status. Provides transparency and efficiency 
  in internship fund management.

#Tech Stack: React.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB
